### Danish Open Access Week 2022 

#### 24-28 October

The Danish Network for Open Access is proud to be able to invite academic staff and students to join a number of webinars on Open Access. The webinars are arranged in connection with the international Open Access Week. Further down you can read more about the programme and sign up for the individual webinars.

Parallel archiving, Article Processing Charges (APC), Diamond, embargoes – there are many terms in play when one talks about Open Access to research publications and teaching materials, so regardless of whether one is a researcher or student, one can quickly lose sight of what is what in this field.

The Danish Network for Open Access has therefore organized a number of webinars that aim to demystify and explain the meaning of Open Access. This is the Danish contribution to the annual international Open Access Week.

The programme addresses both researchers (academic staff) and students, and the individual webinars will cover all aspects of the Open Access universe. There will be presentations that begin at the beginning and explain the basic details of Open Access – and there will be presentations that will look at and explain the more complicated aspects of Open Access, for example the intricacies of the Plan S-initiative.

10 webinars are held in the course of week 43 (24-28 October 2022). For details about the individual webinars, see below. All the webinars are free of charge and anyone can sign up.
