<p>Creative Commons licenses are the most widely used copyright licenses for research outputs and have become an integral part of the publishing process in the wake of the Open Science movement. As a researcher, you will often find yourself in situations, where you must choose a Creative Commons license when your manuscript is accepted for publication. Choosing a license requires knowledge on what characterizes the individual licenses and your choice of license depends on what you want users to be able to use your publication for.</p>

* What should researchers consider when choosing a license?
* What role does copyright ownership play when licensing publications?
