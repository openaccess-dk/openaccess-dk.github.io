This presentation will tackle the basics of Open Access publishing. What it is, in comparison to other academic publishing models, how it works, and how an author can build an Open Access publishing strategy. Being a basic introduction, no prior knowledge about Open Access or academic publishing generally is required. The talk will also touch briefly on issues surrounding copyright and Open Access, as well as funding in the Danish context.
