In this talk, Joe Deville will explore some of the challenges in the dominant funding models for publishing Open Access books as well as introducing a potential alternative. He will focus in particular on Book Processing Charges (BPCs), suggesting that BPCs not only exacerbate existing inequalities in the scholarly publishing landscape, but represent a failure of infrastructural imagination. The talk will then move on to discuss the work of the Open Book Collective, a new charity working to deliver alternative funding streams to Open Access book publishers and infrastructure providers, via collaborations with libraries.
