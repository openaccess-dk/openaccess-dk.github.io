Creative Commons (CC) licenses are the most widely used copyright licenses for research outputs and have become an integral part of the publishing process in the wake of the Open Science movement. As a researcher, you are will often find yourself in situations, where you must choose between several Creative Commons licenses when your manuscript is accepted for publication. Choosing a license requires knowledge of what distinguishes the individual licenses from each other. This presentation will shed light on what Creative Commons licenses means: What is the differences between the individual licenses; and what should you, as a researcher, consider when choosing a license?
In addition, the presentation is also an introduction to some of the copyright concepts that come into play when publishing research, including the implications of assigning copyright to a publisher.
