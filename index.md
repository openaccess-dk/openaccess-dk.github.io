## Danish Network of Open Access

The _Danish Network for Open Access_ consists of employees from Danish educational institutions 
who deal with the dissemination as well as operational and developmental issues in relation to Open Access. 
The purpose of the Network is to be a forum for knowledge sharing and discussion on practical issues and challenges 
that the institutions are faced with in their daily work with Open Access. 
The Network is organized independent of stakeholder organizations and projects/funding.
