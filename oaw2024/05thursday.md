<p>Join Jeannette Ekstrøm for an insightful and practical online workshop on accessing and reusing Open Educational Resources (OER) in your own teaching or skills development. The 60-minute webinar will be tailored for librarians, information specialists, and educators, and will delve into how OER supports the open science agenda too, by promoting accessibility, options for collaboration, and innovation in education.</p>
<p>The webinar will briefly introduce OER as concept, but the main focus will be to discover and discuss relevant (pedagogical) benefits of OER, and you will participate in hands-on exercises to identify and adapt resources relevant for your needs. Don’t miss out!</p>
