<p>In this interactive 2 hour session, we discuss the nuances of openly licensing research output, including data and software. Our aim is to equip you with working knowledge about how and when to apply open licenses to research outputs, and what factors to consider in the process, from funding and institutional requirements to data privacy and aims of the project, as well as how to advocate for open licensing in your institution.<br> 
This training is an adaption of the Skills4EOSC pallet of learning materials about Open Licenses for Data, Software and Code. The full pallet of materials are available here in our the [Github webpage](https://task-4-2.github.io/Open-Licenses-data-code-and-software/latest/) and we invite you to reuse, repurpose and adapt them to your local environment. <br><br>
Agnes is a Research Data Specialist at the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) at the University of Edinburgh. She has a Ph.D. in Neuroscience and over ten years of experience working with various types of research data, both as a scientist and a data services specialist. Her current focus is on developing training for Open Science projects such as Skills4EOSC and FAIR-Impact, including on research data management and open licensing.</p>
