Over recent years, the policy environment has shaped the open access and open science agendas in global higher education. This presentation provides an overview of open science policies at a national level in the UK and at an institutional level within the University of Edinburgh. This presentation reviews what has worked well and why, describing the development of the University of Edinburgh’s current [Research Publications & Copyright Policy (2021)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/research-publications), which is a ‘rights-retention’ publications policy, and assesses the efficacy of this policy in practice, 18 months since its introduction.<br><br>
